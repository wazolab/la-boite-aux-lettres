description: Gestural and spirited script typeface, inspired by street writing. Available at Letters from Sweden. Letterforms are spaced extremely tightly, vary in height and balance themselves around a center line rather than sitting still on the baseline. Uppercase and lowercase follow peculiar strokes’ path, inspired by unique letterforms found in graffiti and street writing. This contributes to a very wild and fierce rhythm within words, especially in all-caps settings. Drawing BAZAAR required to question some of the most common features of a good typeface – balance and harmony. It is an ode to disorder and a tribute to those who challenge the rules. The typeface family comes in five weights, from Light to Black, and offers extensive language support along with contextual alternates and a set of icons.
